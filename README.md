# Preventive Medicine Automation Module
This repository intended to provide basic programming function for Preventive Medicine provider contract, scheduling, eligibility evaluation, letter of guarantee, and billing report.

This module has dependency with the following repositories:
1. https://github.com/vincentiusbudhyanto/01.0_Otomatisasi-Microsoft-Office

I'm still building the basic foundation for this module, but currently it will run with Microsoft Office Excel and Outlook.

Best regards,

Dr. Vincentius Simeon Weo Budhyanto
